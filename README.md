## 👋 Hello! I’m Bittu  
I’m a Software Engineer based in Pune, India — combining creativity, logic and code to build intuitive, impactful apps that make learning effortless.

> *“In code I see patterns. In design I see possibility. I create when both align.”*

### 🧩 My Philosophy  
I believe software should effortlessly belong in the user’s world — invisible when it works, memorable when it doesn’t.  
I seek that “aha” moment in design, that elegant logic in code, and that spark of joy in building something useful.  
Let’s build something great.
